# Habits & Goals Tracker

### What the application does:

This application helps individuals stay on track with new habits, such as working out, reading a book, or
completing a coding project. Users can add as many habits as they want to their habit tracker and *track the number of
hours* they have completed each one. Users can also *set customized rewards* (i.e. "rest day" or "hang out with friends")
for each habit and set the amount of hours needed to complete the habit to obtain the reward. As people often pull out 
when their goal is not imminent, using short-term rewards helps keep people on-track and "reset" to follow through with 
their habits in the long-term.
